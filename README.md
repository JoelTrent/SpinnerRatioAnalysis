# SpinnerRatioAnalysis

This repository contains functions for spinner ratio analysis for geothermal well completion tests in python. This demonstrates the application of the methodology described in the [NZGW paper](https://www.geothermalworkshop.co.nz/) being presented in Nov. 2024. An example set of fluid velocity profiles from two injection flow rates during a stage test is provided.

This paper and code has been developed during work as a Reservoir Engineer at Contact Energy Ltd. 

Plots have been developed starting from plots created in
[T21-Tutorial-WellTestAnalysis](https://github.com/ICWallis/T21-Tutorial-WellTestAnalysis/tree/main).
